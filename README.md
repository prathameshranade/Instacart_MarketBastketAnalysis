# Instacart_MarketBastketAnalysis
Recent grocery shopping trends show increasing dependence on online grocery platforms for buying even the basic daily supplies ranging from milk and bread to toilet paper. This trend has given rise to numerous online grocery delivery platforms like Instacart, Postmates, Cornershop, Buymie, etc. Within the last few years, many big retailers like Target, Walmart, etc. have also come up with their own delivery mobile applications.
However, these online grocery platformsâ€™ primary focus has been increasing consumer base and sales at these platforms. Most platforms focus on consumers instead of retailers. With this project, my team and I leveraged consumer experience and basket size analytics in enabling retailers to study consumer behavior and purchase patterns. These patterns can determine how retailers can organize marketing campaigns like discounts, product bundling, product aisle arrangements, or product inventory management.
